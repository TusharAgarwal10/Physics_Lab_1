Abstract

The aim of the experiment is to conduct experiments and study the stretch profile of a slink. 
The experiment is divided into two parts. In the first part, the spring constant of a section 
of the slinky is measured, and in the second part, the stretch profile of the same section with 
the same spring constant is studied. In this report, the details of the experiment and the findings 
are presented.

13th Feb and 15th Feb
Experiment 2: 	Minimum-energy Configuration of a Slinky

Part 1: Measured the spring constant by studying the relationship between the extension of a section of a slinky with different masses attached at the end.
Part 2: Studied the relationship between the extension length of each section of a slinky and and its original length.

Data collected with my lab partner, Shreyansh Kumar.
