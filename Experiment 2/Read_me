Experiment 2: 	Minimum-energy Configuration of a Slinky

Part 1: Measured the spring constant by studying the relationship between the extension of a section of a slinky with different masses attached at the end.
Part 2: Studied the relationship between the extension length of each section of a slinky and and its original length.
