Abstract

The aim of the experiment is to conduct experiments and identify how the time period of a 
simple pendulum is affected when its mass, length, or angle of release is varied. Some of 
the data collected are then used to calculate the acceleration due to gravity. In this 
report, the details of the experiment and the findings are presented.
