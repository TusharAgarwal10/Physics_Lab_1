Abstract: The aim of the experiment is to conduct experiments and identify how the time period of a 
simple pendulum is affected when its mass, length, or angle of release is varied. Some of 
the data collected are then used to calculate the acceleration due to gravity. In this 
report, the details of the experiment and the findings are presented. 

Data collected on: 30th Jan and 1st Feb	

Experiment 1: Simple Pendulum		

Part 1:	Mass vs Time Period

Part 2: Length vs (Time Period)^2

Part 3: Angle of Release vs Time Period

Data was collected with my lab partner, Shreyansh Kumar.
