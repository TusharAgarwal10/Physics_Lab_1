Abstract: 
The aim of the experiment is to study how a ray of light diffracts upon passing through diffraction gratings, single slits, and circular apertures by analyzing the diffraction pattern obtained on a screen. The data points obtained in the process is then to be used to study the various components of the setup and understand the relationship between them and gather more information about them such as wavelength of the light source, width of slit, diameter of aperture.
